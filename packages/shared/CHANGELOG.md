# @escapesuite/shared

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 236a7dc: Modal keyboard behaviour lives in one place: `useDialogBehaviour`, exported as
  `@escapesuite/shared/hooks`. It moved out of ESCAPECRAFT — where it had been lifted from
  ESCAPEARTIST's export dialog — so all three dialogs in the suite share it, and gained an
  optional `isOpen` argument for a dialog that stays mounted while closed.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 50491ce: The offline single-file builds no longer include the analytics runtime at all, so no analytics call can leave an offline build. `trackEvent()` returns before it reaches Vercel Analytics in a standalone build, and the gate is written so the bundler drops the library from the bundle rather than shipping it inert.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 90969e4: New config helpers: `isEmbedded()`, `EDITOR_URL` / `editorUrl(params)` driven by the optional `VITE_EDITOR_URL` build variable, and `parseHostOrigin()`.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- b9f8928: Updated test tooling for the Node 24 baseline: vitest 5, jsdom 30, jest-dom 7, vite 8.2.2, eslint 10.9, mediabunny 1.55.2, and changesets 3.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add standalone licensing system with pre-licensed downloads

  ### ESCAPEPLAN

  - **Pre-Licensed Downloads**: Server-side license injection - users download HTML with license already embedded
  - **Downloads Page**: "Download (Pre-Licensed)" button for instant-use downloads, "Generic" for manual key entry
  - **Edge Functions**: `get-licensed-download` for personalized builds, `get-user-licenses` for portal, `send-license-email` for purchase emails
  - **Database Migrations**: `license_activations` table, `downloads` storage bucket

  ### ESCAPECRAFT & ESCAPEARTIST

  - **License Input Modal**: Runtime license key entry UI for standalone builds
  - **Machine Hash**: Browser fingerprinting for activation tracking
  - **Dashboard Link**: Hidden in standalone mode (no dashboard exists)
  - **Analytics**: Removed from standalone builds (runs offline)

  ### Shared Package

  - **LicenseInputModal**: Reusable license entry component
  - **machineHash**: Cross-browser machine identification
  - **Bootstrap**: Analytics excluded from standalone mode
